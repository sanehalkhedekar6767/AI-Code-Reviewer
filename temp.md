❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` does not declare or define the variables `a` and `b`. This will lead to the function attempting
to access variables that are not in its scope, likely resulting in `NaN` being returned or an error if 'a' and 'b' are
not defined in the outer scope.
* ❌ There are no parameters defined for the function, which means there's no way to pass in the numbers you want to sum
up.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔ The function now takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are the numbers to be summed.
* ✔ The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

Final Note:
Always define your variables and ensure your functions accept the necessary parameters to perform their intended tasks.
This avoids unexpected behavior and makes your code more maintainable.
